# RetPred
Prediction of a user retention
In this work I made an statistical description of dataset, analysis of features and missing values in the first notebook (description.ipynb). 
 
Then I made data cleaning, detected returning users by BrowserId and purified dataset from anons. Dataset is enough unbalanced by returing/non-returing users, so, balancing of data before training was necessary 
 
Input features were converted to sparced matrices, as they were strings and required NLP of string vectorizing
I used three algorithms (decision three, logistic regression and random forest), also began to apply keras neural networks, but i need more computing power (more than 1 GPU)
 
For all training process I determined score as for binary classifiers
